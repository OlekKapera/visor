# Visor

Visor is a TypeScript CLI for verified interaction with running mobile apps.

Instead of inferring UI behavior from code alone, Visor captures evidence from the live app: interactions, screenshots, UI source, assertions, and run artifacts.

## What Visor does

- interacts with iOS and Android apps through Appium
- captures screenshots and UI source from live app state
- executes repeatable scenarios with ordered steps
- evaluates visibility assertions after execution
- writes artifacts and reports for review and automation
- measures determinism across repeated runs

## Why teams use it

- reduce guesswork in agent-driven UI work
- verify real app behavior instead of code intent alone
- keep reproducible evidence for debugging and review
- add a repeatable verification layer around mobile UI changes

## Scope

Visor is focused on mobile app verification.

Supported today:

- Android
- iOS
- real Appium-backed runs
- mock runs for predictable dry-run behavior

## Install

Visor ships as the npm package `visor-ai` and requires Node `20` or later.

```bash
npm install -g visor-ai
visor --help
```

## Documentation

Comprehensive product documentation lives in [the docs site](https://na-ca6c7a2b.mintlify.app).

## Releases

Create a release by running one of:

```bash
npm run release:patch
npm run release:minor
npm run release:major
```

Each command runs `npm run check`, bumps the version, creates the matching `vX.Y.Z` git tag, and pushes the commit and tag upstream with `git push --follow-tags`.
